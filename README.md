## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of:

- Responsive design using CSS media queries:
  ```css
  @media (max-width: 768px) {
    .qr-container {
      width: 85%;
    }
  }
  ```
- Centering elements using Flexbox:
  ```css
  body {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
  }
  ```
- Adjusting text alignment and ensuring elements remain centered even with width restrictions:
  ```css
  h1 {
    margin: 15px auto;
    text-align: center;
  }
  ```
